      "description": "I have been developing a physically-based ray-tracer in Rust from scratch. Initially it was developed for the CPU which was then also expanded for real-time GPU rendering. This includes a custom math and graphics library, an object-loading library as well as domain-specific data-structures and algorithms.\n\nThe library contains an efficient flattened implementation of a BVH tree (to be used as an acceleration structure for complex scenes) as well as cameras, multiple BSDFs, lighting types, shapes, textures and samplers. It includes an implementation of a complete Path Tracer as well as simpler Direct Lighting and Ambient Occlusion shaders.\n\nThe entire project is structured to be modular and the code is written in a highly functional manner for easier access. Despite this, the renderer is very performant and compiles down to optimized code for all types of geometric computations."

My tasks involved the calibration of the various sensors in both the spatial and temporal domain to allow for fusion of the sensors data for combined processing.\n\nMy secondary role was the programming of various AVR32 microcontrollers on the car for interfacing with various components such as the Inertial Navigation System (INS), Low Voltage controller (LV), accumulators (AKKU), dashboard (DB), and the CAN interface tying them all together."
